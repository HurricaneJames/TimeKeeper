# Description #
Back in 2011 I wanted to create an Android application to help me keep track of time spent on various projects. It should have basic stopwatch functionality tied to an optional "project" name. It should also support adding "Notes" to the time recordings. Notes are text blobs, lists, images/videos, and/or sound recordings. The general use case was to click start and then type or say what project was being done.

Shortly after starting the uphil trduge that is learning Android development, a new job happened. Then life got even more complicated. Ultimately TimeKeeper, and Android development in general, was put on the back burner.

Luckly, my design was pretty good, because Google released Google Keep a year or so later. Google Keep was almost everything in the original design, minus the time tracking. It was "good enough" for most of what wanted.

Skip forward a couple years and there is some time and a desire to develop Android apps again. This is really a "MyFirstAndroid" type app, so it is probably best not to expect it to do anything useful for a while.

# Compatibility #
This app is designed to work with KitKat and newer (API 19+). At some point it may be extended to older devices, but for now, this is just easier.
